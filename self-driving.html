        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="focus-in-expand">
            The "Self Driving Car Using OpenCV" project leverages computer vision techniques implemented 
            with OpenCV and machine learning models developed using TensorFlow/Keras to enable a car to 
            drive autonomously. The project involves collecting driving data, preprocessing it, training a 
            deep neural network model, and deploying the model to control the car's steering and throttle in 
            real-time. This system aims to demonstrate the fusion of computer vision and machine learning 
            for autonomous vehicle navigation.

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <h4>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h4>
            <p>
                Data is collected using a simulator and stored in a CSV file containing information about 
                image paths and corresponding steering angles. Images are preprocessed to focus on the 
                region of interest, converted to the YUV color space, resized, and normalized.
            </p>
            <h4>Data Augmentation</h4>
            <p>
                Various data augmentation techniques such as zooming, panning, brightness alteration, and 
                flipping are applied to increase the diversity of training data and improve model 
                generalization.
            </p>
            <h4>Model Architecture</h4>
            <p>
                Constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model inspired by NVIDIA's architecture for 
                self-driving cars. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict steering angles 
                based on input images.
            </p>
            <h4>Training and Validation</h4>
            <p>
                Training includes data augmentation techniques such as zoom, pan, brightness alteration, 
                and horizontal flipping to enhance model robustness.
                The model is trained on augmented data generated from the collected images. Training 
                progress is monitored using validation data, and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function 
                is minimized using the Adam optimizer.
            </p>
            <h4>Deployment</h4>
            <p>
                The trained model is deployed on a web server using Flask and Socket.IO. The server 
                communicates with a front-end client, receiving telemetry data (image and speed) and 
                sending back control commands (steering angle and throttle) to control the simulated car.
            </p>
            <h4>Speed Limit</h4>
            <p>
                A speed limit is enforced to ensure safe driving, and throttle is adjusted accordingly 
                based on the current speed of the car.
            </p>
            <h4>Real-time Control</h4>
            <p>
                The deployed system allows real-time control of the simulated car, where the model predicts 
                steering angles based on input images and adjusts throttle based on speed, enabling 
                autonomous driving in the simulator.
            </p>
